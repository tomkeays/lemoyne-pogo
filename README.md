## Reporting Raids

Report in the `#announce-raids-here` channel in Discord. 

Command takes this form: "`$raid latios chapel 37`", where:

* `$raid` is the command
* `latios` is the name of the Pokemon (case insensitive)
* `chapel` is the name of the POI; can use alias or full name
* `37` is the number of minutes until despawn

If egg still hasn't hatched, instead use the `$egg` command. 

E.G., "`$egg giratina dolphy 51`", where:

* `$egg` is the command
* `giratina` is the name of the Pokemon, if known; else use the tier, e.g., `T5`
* `dolphy` is the name of the POI; can use alias or full name
* `51` is the number of minutes until hatch
